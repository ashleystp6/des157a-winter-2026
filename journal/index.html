            <p>We have all had to fill out forms for years whether we are signing up for an account on a new website, checking out while online shopping, or taking a survey. Most recently, I've been applying to jobs and internships which require filling out a lot of badly designed forms. Many forms ask for too much information or information that can easily be found on my resume that I had already attached. Others had a drop down menu asking for what my major was but design wasn't an option so I would have to put 'other'. Little things like these made me not want to continue filling out the form. <br> The article talked about many aspects of forms that make them easier for users to fill out and understand. One thing they talked about was chunking the form into multiple steps. By having a few pages to go through, the user will not be so overwhelmed by the amount of questions. They also mentioned having a progress bar at the top to show how much the user has left which I think is very useful. Another important part of forms is where the label is located in relation to the input field. Placing a label on the top left right above the input field is the best place for it so there is no confusion and makes filling out the form faster. A good amount of spacing between each input field also helps make sure the user knows which label goes with each input field. <br> A form that has good design is this job application for OpenAI. Compared to other job applications, the questions are limited and simple. Labels are used correctly as well as red asterisks showing the required fields to fill out. <br>
