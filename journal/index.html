                I explored the website 'Shoot for the Future' and after scrolling through just a little of the page it was clear to me that they were very thoughtful with their background imagery. First off, the color palette is very simple being mainly just black, white, green, and blue. As the user scrolls, the background shifts to the side and uses a 3D space to reveal videos and text. As the user scrolls more, another 3D space is used and moves around to reveal green squares with numbers and overlay text. Squares are used throughout the website to create the backgrounds and some images. All the imagery that is created in this website seems very intentional and kept me interested while scrolling. I didn't have to question the useage of anything. <br>

                Modals are elements that sit on top of the main window so the user can still see the main page. The user must close this modal to go back to the main page. They are used to grab the user's attention, make the user sign up or login to something, and to show additional information with or without context such as pictures or notifications. Good modal windows have a few key features. First there needs to be a way for the user to close it either using a close button or the esacpe key usually. There also must be a title to tell the user what the modal is. Any buttons on the modal should have clear names or icons associated with them. The modal also shouldn't be too large to fill the whole screen or not big enough to catch the user's attention. Using a lightbox effect to make the main page darker than the modal also helps to direct attention. Typically users try to automatically close the modal, however they can be useful in some cases to simplify the UI of the main page and to get the user's attention quickly. When visiting a site, I typically close the modal when it comes up especially if it wants me to make an account for something. Other times I can see where they can be useful such as offering deals on shopping sites. <br>

            <p>We have all had to fill out forms for years whether we are signing up for an account on a new website, checking out while online shopping, or taking a survey. Most recently, I've been applying to jobs and internships which require filling out a lot of badly designed forms. Many forms ask for too much information or information that can easily be found on my resume that I had already attached. Others had a drop down menu asking for what my major was but design wasn't an option so I would have to put 'other'. Little things like these made me not want to continue filling out the form. <br> The article talked about many aspects of forms that make them easier for users to fill out and understand. One thing they talked about was chunking the form into multiple steps. By having a few pages to go through, the user will not be so overwhelmed by the amount of questions. They also mentioned having a progress bar at the top to show how much the user has left which I think is very useful. Another important part of forms is where the label is located in relation to the input field. Placing a label on the top left right above the input field is the best place for it so there is no confusion and makes filling out the form faster. A good amount of spacing between each input field also helps make sure the user knows which label goes with each input field. <br> A form that has good design is this job application for OpenAI. Compared to other job applications, the questions are limited and simple. Labels are used correctly as well as red asterisks showing the required fields to fill out. <br>
